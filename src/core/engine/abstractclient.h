 * @brief Interface for the proxy implementation of each client

 * The client interface is the only way to interact with the game.
 * Each client retrieves the information about the current game state via
 * a set signals and the information passed through the Participant object.
 *
 * The participant object es designed as a @c readonly object for the clients
 * only meant for status information.
 *
 * Each client can interact with its own robot through the CardDeck, which is the only
 * changeable object in this poxy.
 *
 * Apart from the other noninteractive parts some slot mechanisms are used to send
 * information about a newly selected starting point plus the orientation of the robot.
 * As well as the signal to anounce that the client finished the programming.
 *
 * Some other passive slots are used to inform the game engine that the client finished its
 * board animation and the engine can start the next part of the phase.
