<h1><a name="About_Bot_Race"></a>About Bot Race</h1>
In this game you control a tiny robot through a big factory maze. You
can program the robots movement with 5 cards and help him to reach its
next goal.<br>
Be careful though the factory is full of dangerous traps.<br>
<h1><a name="The_Interface"></a>The Interface</h1>The game interface concists of 4 parts:<br>
<h3>Gameboard:</h3>
This is the board where the robots will be shown and moved on. You can
zoom in and out via a menu entry or by using the mouse wheel.<br>
<h3>Carddeck:</h3>
The carddeck shows all available cards for the current round you can
use to program the robot. The player receives 9 Cards, minus 1 card for
each damage token it receives.<br>
Cards can be placed in the program slots bei either double-click or drag and drop.<br>
<h3>Statuswindow:</h3>
In this window additional information about the game are shown.<br>
<h3>Robot Control Panel:</h3>

<img style="width: 681px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="images/program.jpg"><br>
The control panel is the main element in the game.<br>
It allows the player to program the the robots via 5 Cards which can be
taken from the robots card deck (by double-click or drag and drop).<br>
In addition the next flag goal is shown in the upper left and the remaining lifes in the bottom left.<br>
<br>
The current damage token are shown on the right side. If the player
receives more than 4 damage tokens for each new token one of the cards
will be locked (shown in grey).<br>
These locked cards can't be changed and won't be returned to teh deck after the phase is over.<br>
<br>
The button in the upper right are used to tell the game that you have
finished programing your robot. The button on the bottom right announce
the power down.<br>
The power down can only be used before the programming is finished and
will power down the robot after the current round is played completely.<br>
<h1><a name="The_Cards"></a>The Cards</h1>
There exist 6 different cards that can be used to program the robot. Each card has in addition a priority printend on it. <br>
In the case that 2 or more robots whould push each other the card with the highest priority will be executed first.<br>

<h2><a name="The_Game_Modes"></a>The Game Modes</h2>Different game modes are available for this game. Each mode has different goals.<br>
<h3><a name="Hunt_the_Flag"></a>Hunt the Flag</h3>
In this mode each robot has to get to the next flag on the board. As soon as one robot reached the last flag the game is over.<br>
<h3><a name="Death_or_Alive"></a>Death or Alive</h3>
In this mode no flags are available. Instead each robot must try to
kill as many other robots as possible the first Robot that reached 10
kills wins the game.<br>
<h3><a name="King_of_The_Flag"></a>King of The Flag</h3>
The goal is to catch the flag and hold it as long as possible. Once you
have the flag you can move around with it. If you die the flag will be
dropped your robot died or placed back to the starting point if you
jumped into a pit. Each Card phase you gain 0.2 points, once you have
reached to points to win <span style="font-style: italic;">(default is 10)</span> you have won the game.<br>
<h3><a name="King_of_the_Hill"></a>King of the Hill</h3>
Simmilar to King of the Flag, but instead of running around with a flag
you need to stay as long as possible at the flag point. Each Card phase
you gain 0.2 points, once you have reached to points to win <span style="font-style: italic;">(default is 10)</span> you have won the game.<br>

<h1><a name="Tips_and_Tricks"></a>Tips and Tricks</h1>
When you prohram your robot think about what other robots might do.
Robots can push each other and you might not end up where you wanted to
be.<br>
Remember higher priority cards are always executed first.<br>
<br>
If you are unsure where you end up after all factory elements are executed you can enable a card simulator <span style="font-style: italic;">(Help-&gt;Show Simulator)</span> this will calculate your robots movement if no other robot interferes.<br>
